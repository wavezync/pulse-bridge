# Pulse Bridge

[![Build](https://github.com/wavezync/pulse-bridge/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wavezync/pulse-bridge/actions/workflows/build.yml) ![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/wavezync/pulse-bridge)
 [![Docker](https://ghcr-badge.egpl.dev/wavezync/pulse-bridge/tags?color=%2344cc11&ignore=latest&n=3&label=image+tags&trim=)](https://github.com/wavezync/pulse-bridge/pkgs/container/pulse-bridge)

Pulse Bridge is a lightweight, powerful uptime monitoring tool for your internal infrastructure (APIs, databases, etc.) and external platforms.

## How it works

Simply create a configuration file to define multiple services and databases to be checked at custom intervals. Pulse Bridge records the health status of each service and database, and provides a simple HTTP API to query their status.

### Currently supports

- HTTP services
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Redis
- MSSQL

## Installation

Pulse Bridge can be deployed in various ways to suit your needs:

- Binary for your [platform](https://github.com/wavezync/pulse-bridge/releases)
- Docker
- Kubernetes

### Quick Install :zap:

Install the latest version with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wavezync/pulse-bridge/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Run locally (Build from source) :computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wavezync/pulse-bridge.git
cd pulse-bridge
go run .
```

### Docker :whale:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/wavezync/pulse-bridge:latest
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/wavezync/pulse-bridge:latest
```

Update the [config.yml](https://github.com/wavezync/pulse-bridge/blob/main/config.yml) in the project root to add your services and databases. Then rebuild the binary or Docker image and run it.

### Kubernetes :ship:

There are many ways to deploy Pulse Bridge on Kubernetes. Below is a simple example using a Deployment, Service, and ConfigMap.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pulse-bridge
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pulse-bridge
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pulse-bridge
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pulse-bridge
        image: wavezync/pulse-bridge:latest # Replace with your image if needed (recommended)
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: PULSE_BRIDGE_CONFIG
          value: "/config/config.yml"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /config
      volumes:
      - name: config-volume
        configMap:
          name: pulse-bridge-config
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: pulse-bridge
spec:
  selector:
    app: pulse-bridge
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: pulse-bridge-config
data:
  config.yml: |
    # Paste your Pulse Bridge YAML config here. See the guide below for configuration details.
```

### Environment Configuration

#### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables to configure Pulse Bridge. These variables can be used to override the default configuration file or set the host and port.

  ```bash
  PULSE_BRIDGE_CONFIG=mycustomconfig.yml # Sets the custom configuration file path, defaults to config.yml
  HOST=0.0.0.0 # Defaults to 0.0.0.0
  PORT=8080 # Defaults to 8080 
  ```

#### CLI arguments

  CLI arguments take priority over environment variables and can be used to override the configuration file or set the host and port.

  ```bash
  pulse-bridge --config=mycustomconfig.yml --port=8080 --host=0.0.0.0
  ```

## Usage

### Configuring your services

The configuration file is a YAML file where you can define the services and databases you want to monitor.

Database monitors can be configured using a connection string or individual parameters (host, port, username, password, database name). The `driver` field is required to specify the database type (e.g., `postgres`, `mysql`, `mariadb`, `mssql`, `redis`).

You may also include a `query` field to run a custom SQL query for health checks, but it is not required.

Example configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
  # HTTP service monitoring
  - name: "HTTP Service"
    type: "http"
    interval: "30s"
    timeout: "5s"
    http:
      url: "http://helloworld-http:8080/ping"
      method: "GET"
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer secret-token"
        Content-Type: "application/json"

  # Postgres monitoring
  - name: "PostgreSQL Service"
    type: "database"
    interval: "30s"
    timeout: "10s"
    database:
      driver: "postgres"
      connection_string: "postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres-db:5432/monitoring?sslmode=disable"
      query: "SELECT 1"

  # MySQL monitoring
  - name: "MySQL Service"
    type: "database"
    interval: "30s"
    timeout: "10s"
    database:
      driver: "mysql"
      connection_string: "root:mysql@tcp(mysql-db:3306)/monitoring"
      query: "SELECT 1"

  # MariaDB monitoring
  - name: "MariaDB Service"
    type: "database"
    interval: "30s"
    timeout: "10s"
    database:
      driver: "mariadb"
      connection_string: "root:mariadb@tcp(mariadb-db:3306)/monitoring"
      query: "SELECT 1"

  # Redis monitoring
  - name: "Redis Service Primary"
    type: "database"
    interval: "5s"
    timeout: "5s"
    database:
      driver: "redis"
      database: "1"
      host: "redis-db"
      port: 6379
      password: "redispassword"

  # MSSQL monitoring
  - name: "MSSQL Service" 
    type: "database"
    interval: "30s"
    timeout: "10s"
    database:
      driver: "mssql"
      host: "mssql-db"
      port: 1433
      username: "SA"
      password: "Password1!"
      database: "master"
      query: "SELECT 1"
```

### Monitoring

You can check the status of your service from the pulse bridge API at the routes:

#### /monitor/services  

- List all monitored services

```json
[
  {
    "service": "HTTP Service",
    "status": "healthy",
    "type": "http",
    "last_check": "2025-07-24 11:56:01.918452021 +0000 UTC m=+0.357002662",
    "last_success": "2025-07-24 11:56:01.918443897 +0000 UTC m=+0.356994537",
    "metrics": {
      "response_time_ms": 81,
      "check_interval": "30s",
      "consecutive_successes": 1
    },
    "last_error": ""
  },
  {
    "service": "PostgreSQL Service",
    "status": "unhealthy",
    "type": "database",
    "last_check": "2025-07-24 11:56:01.891732112 +0000 UTC m=+0.330282750",
    "last_success": "",
    "metrics": {
      "response_time_ms": 50,
      "check_interval": "30s",
      "consecutive_successes": 0
    },
    "last_error": "failed to ping database: dial tcp 172.23.0.3:5432: connect: connection refused"
  }
 ]
```

#### /monitor/services/{monitor_name}

- Get details of a specific service

```json
  {
    "service": "MariaDB Service",
    "status": "unhealthy",
    "type": "database",
    "last_check": "2025-07-24 11:56:01.89172233 +0000 UTC m=+0.330272963",
    "last_success": "",
    "metrics": {
      "response_time_ms": 33,
      "check_interval": "30s",
      "consecutive_successes": 0
